Each algorithm compares the current iterator agains end() and not the start of
the next subsection of the list that is handled by the next thread (if any)
because the complexity for relational operators on forward_list is "Up to
linear in the size of lhs and rhs." and we think that maybe comparisons agains
end() would be more efficient if end() returned a null pointer. However we think
this is not the case and it actually just returns a pointer one past the end of
the container. In any case we decide to leave it like this because it is less
complex and hopefully should somehow be faster. Also it must be noted that it
should not matter because this is only done for read operations.
